## Papers

* [Neural Open Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04270.pdf): AFAIK, the first use of ANNs (seq2seq with attention) applied to OpenIE. Author bootstrapped tuples from OpenIE-4 and makes the data available.
* [Supervised Open Information Extraction](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1081):
